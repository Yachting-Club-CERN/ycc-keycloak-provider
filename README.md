# YCC Keycloak Provider

This Keycloak provider connects our Oracle DB users to Keycloak. Handy, since we can keep running
both old and new generation components.

For developers, start by reading
[this guide](https://www.baeldung.com/java-keycloak-custom-user-providers) and check out
[this demo](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts/tree/latest/user-storage-jpa) and
[this one](https://github.com/dasniko/keycloak-user-spi-demo). Also, there is
an [official documentation](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_development/index.html#_user-storage-spi).
